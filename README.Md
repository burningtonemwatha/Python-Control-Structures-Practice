## Python Practice – Conditional Statements, Data Types & Loops

This project contains **15 small Python programs** that demonstrate the use of **conditional statements**, **loops**, **data types**, and **basic collection operations**.
Each file is written as a **stand-alone script**, meaning you can run them individually to test your understanding of Python control structures.

### Learning Objectives

* Practice using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
* Work with `for` and `while` loops
* Understand `match–case` (Python 3.10+)
* Perform simple type conversions and dictionary operations
* Use collections like lists and dictionaries effectively
